moderator | monday123 | ABC123 (MOD)<br/>CSC104 (MOD)<br/>CSC108 (MOD)<br/>CSC148 (MOD)<br/>CSC165 (MOD)

## Communities

* ABC123 is the community where most of the testing will be done. Setup of ABC123 should look like this:
    * Is private: true
    * Community description has a typo
    * Pending application from "potato"
    * No badges
* Every other community should have some combination of unavailable/available badges, and should have user "potato" as a member
    * This is meant to simulate what the system will look like once a user has joined many communities
    * A random community should have 0 badges, since a message is displayed when a community has no available badges

# Script

## Introduction

Hi (user), I'm (name) and I'm hoping to gather user feedback on Badgepack, a web-based badge achievement system. I'll be asking you to go through a few tasks, and for each task, I ask that you voice your thoughts as often as possible.

## Tasks

### Moderator

* First, we will be going through the site as a moderator. Please login with the username "admin" and the password "monday123". Both of these are in lowercase.
* We want to go to the community page for the course "ABC123". How do you think we can get to it?
* Please add a new badge to ABC123 with any name, description, and image you'd like.
* When a badge is first created, it is initially set to "unavailable" -- that is, it cannot be given to any members until made publicly available. Set the badge you created to "available".
* Now, let's move onto some user management stuff. If you wanted to view a list of users in the community, how would you do so?
* "potato" has a really good username, so let's award them for it. How would you give "potato" the badge you just created?
* Okay, now let's say you want to add a new user to the community, and their username is "user". How would you do it?
* Someone has informed you that the description for the community has a typo. How do you think we could fix it?
* _(on the Community Settings page)_ This is where you would find and modify settings for a community. What do you think about this page? Is it straightforward and intuitive to use? Do you feel like it might benefit from more stuff?
* A community can be set to either public or private. What do you think this means?
* A user has sent in an application to join the ABC123 community. How would you view and accept their request?
* "potato" wants to be a moderator for ABC123. How would you change their permissions?
* Do you have any further thoughts about the site when viewing it as a moderator of various communities? Feel free to click around and explore the site.
* _(to faculty members)_ As the owner of a community, how much power would you want your moderators to have within your community? Are there things that a moderator shouldn't be able to do? Would you want moderators to be able to make badges, or should they only be allowed to gift badges to earners?

### User

* Now we're going to go through the site as a regular user. Please log out of the site, and sign in with the username "user", and password "monday123".
* This is what users see for the first time when joining the site. At the moment, you're not a part of any community, so let's go ahead and join one. Earlier, we sent an invitation to ABC123 to this user. How would you view and accept the invitation?
* Your main page has now been updated to show the badges in the community. Since we only created one badge earlier, there is only one badge listed in the community. How do you feel about the way this page currently looks?
* Navigate to the community page for ABC123. This is what a community page looks like for a regular user of a community. What do you think about it, layout and content-wise? Is there anything else you'd like to see on this page?
* Finally, log out and sign in as the user "potato", using the password "monday123". "potato" is a member of multiple communities, and their main page displays a list of all their communities, as well as which badges they've earned. How do you feel about this layout?
* Feel free to click around and explore the site as "potato". Do you have any further thoughts about the site when viewing it as a regular user?
